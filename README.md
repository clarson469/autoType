# Auto-Type v0.1.0

## What is it?
A React component that simulates the typing of a string.

## How does it work?
Copy the "\autotype" folder into your React project, and import `AutoType`. Give it a list of strings you want it to type, away you go.  
You can customise it in various ways:
 * Styling individual blocks of text
 * Change the speed, or jittery-ness of the typing animation
 * Make it overwrite itself, leave a trail of previously typed strings in its wake
 * Skip the animation at any point
